# gazebo-pioneer-leaderfollower
ROSâ€“Gazebo simulation for Pioneer 3-DX UGVs in leaderâ€“follower collaboration. The leader follows a square trajectory with event-driven rotations, while the follower uses adaptive control and state-based behaviors (pause, gap closing, yaw alignment). MQTT ensures robust, real-time inter-robot coordination.
